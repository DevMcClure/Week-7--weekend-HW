### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.

# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.:
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc.

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer.

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

# function 1 - else missing colon
# function 1 - card.value should have ==
# function 2 - dif should be def
# function 2 - return card should be return card1
# function 2 - no comma after card1
# function 2 requires indentation on the if/else statement.
# function 3 - total has no value
# function 3 - not indented to the class.
# function 3 - return is indented incorrectly.


class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False


  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2



def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total

```
